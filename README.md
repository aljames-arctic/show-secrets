GMs, do you use secret blocks in item descriptions to keep some information a secret from your players? Of course you do. It's a great way to keep that information from prying eyes. Unfortunately, it also means when you use that feature/attack/spell the secret is hidden, even from you, in the chat message. This module will show you those secrets in the chat message.
