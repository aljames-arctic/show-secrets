Secret blocks are a great way for GMs to keep information hidden from players. In an item's description, for example, you might include some special information about an attack that you do not want your players to see so it doesn't ruin the surprise. Putting that information in a secret block is a great way to hide it from them. Unfortunately, it also means when you use that item, the secret is hidden from everyone in the chat message. This module will show you, the GM, those secrets in the chat message.
