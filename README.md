# Show Secrets

GMs, do you use secret blocks in item descriptions to keep some information a secret from your players? Of course you do. It's a great way to keep that information from prying eyes. Unfortunatly, it also means when you use that feature/attack/spell the secret is hidden, even from you, in the chat message. This module will show you those secrets in the chat message.

Viewing the secret blocks does require that the user be an owner of the actor that generated the message.

## Settings

There is a setting to choose whether this behavior works for GMs only (default) or for everyone.
